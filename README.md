We cannot guarantee the availability or validity of all Xtream codes generated by the AppleXtream application. Users are encouraged to verify the validity of Xtream codes before using them to access Internet television services.

We also encourage you to use legitimate and authorized sources for accessing Internet television services. If you encounter any issues or concerns regarding the Xtream codes generated by the AppleXtream application, please contact us at [medsa576@gmail.com].
